    <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to Your Virtual Library</h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Sometimes it is hard keeping track of every book, movie, and game you own. This is especially true for collectors, movie buffs, gamers, and avid readers, such as yourself. However, with your virtual library, keeping record of your multimedia is a breeze</p>
    <br />
    <p>To add a new book, movie, or game, click &quot;Check In&quot;. You will be taken to a menu that asks you what you would like to check-in to the library. Once you have chosen, type in the necessary information and click add. Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a new item in your library.</p>
    <br />
    <p>You can also easily search your library records. To search, click &quot;Check Out&quot;. You will be taken to a search menu. You can choose to search specifically through your books, movies, or games, or you could choose to see your entire library. If you choose a specific section to search, you can use things like the title or creator to find objects that have these things in common. Use this to find books with the same author, movies with the same director, games that came out the same year, or more.</p>
